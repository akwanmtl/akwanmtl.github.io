          I'm a full stack web developer with a vast experience in customer support and troubleshooting. Originally from Montr√©al, I'm presently based in Toronto.

          I have always had an interest in developing applications that simplify tasks. Prior to the Bootcamp, I have built a website with a goal to make language-exchange more interactive and a Matlab-based GUI to visualize and analyze data. Now, I have gained more knowledge and skills and have built applications geared towards aspiring cooks, book lovers and developers to further expand their interests.

          When you don't find me working, you can find me in the kitchen baking sweet treats or outside enjoying a nice long walk. I also enjoy playing video games, in particular, Smash Bros and I'm always looking for a friendly competition.
